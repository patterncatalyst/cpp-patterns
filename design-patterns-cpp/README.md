# Introduction

This demonstrates:

    * Modern C++ Design Patterns
    * Modern C++ techniques
    * Modern C++ features (11, 14, 17)

The example also shows how to setup a CMake project which includes sub-projects.


# Sub-Projects

[SOLID](solid-cpp) design principles

[Creational](creational-cpp) design patterns

[Structural](structural-cpp) design patterns

# Pre-requisites

You should have the following installed:

  * Git
  * CLion
  * CMake
  * Boost (on the path or in Mingw)
  * Valgrind (We will do some Modern C++ concurrency in a few sections)
  * gcc (Windows Mingw, Mac CLang or gcc)
